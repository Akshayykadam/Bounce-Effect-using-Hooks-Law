# Bounce Effect Script using Hooke's Law Physics Principles

## Overview

This script implements a basic bounce effect using Hooke's Law physics principles in Unity. When a collision occurs with an object having a Rigidbody component, it calculates the displacement between the collision point and the position of the object with this script attached. It then computes a spring force based on Hooke's Law (F = -k * x - d * v), where:

- **F**: Spring force
- **k**: Spring constant (a measure of stiffness)
- **x**: Displacement vector
- **d**: Damping factor (a measure of resistance to motion)
- **v**: Velocity of the colliding object

The maximum force magnitude is capped to prevent excessive forces. Finally, the calculated spring force is applied to the colliding object as an impulse force.

## Usage

1. Attach the script to objects in the Unity scene that you want to exhibit the bounce effect.
2. Ensure that objects you want to interact with have Rigidbody components.
3. Adjust the `springConstant` and `dampingFactor` parameters in the script inspector to control the behavior of the bounce effect.
4. Play the scene and observe the bounce effect when collisions occur.

## Script Parameters

- **Spring Constant (`float`)**: Controls the stiffness of the spring. Higher values result in stiffer springs.
- **Damping Factor (`float`)**: Controls the resistance to motion of the spring. Higher values result in more damping.

## Example

```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class BounceEffect : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField] private float springConstant = 100f; // Spring constant
    [SerializeField] private float dampingFactor = 10f;   // Damping factor

    private void OnCollisionEnter(Collision collision)
    {
        Rigidbody rb = collision.gameObject.GetComponent<Rigidbody>();

        if (rb != null)
        {
            Vector3 collisionPoint = collision.contacts[0].point;
            Vector3 displacement = collisionPoint - transform.position;
            Vector3 velocity = rb.velocity;
            
            // Calculate spring force using Hooke's Law
            Vector3 springForce = -springConstant * displacement - dampingFactor * velocity;

            // Cap maximum force magnitude to prevent excessive forces
            const float maxForceMagnitude = 1000f;
            if (springForce.magnitude > maxForceMagnitude)
            {
                springForce = springForce.normalized * maxForceMagnitude;
            }

            // Apply spring force as an impulse to the colliding object
            rb.AddForce(springForce, ForceMode.Impulse);
        }
    }
}
```

## Notes

- Ensure that the Rigidbody component of the colliding object has sufficient mass for realistic bounce behavior.
- Adjust the script parameters (`springConstant` and `dampingFactor`) to achieve the desired bounce effect.
